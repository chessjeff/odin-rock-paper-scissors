Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a console based player-versus-computer version of Rock, Paper, Scissors written in javascript and html. It contains a "game()" function which begins by prompting the player's selection, calls a function that randomly decides computer's selection, calls another function that compares each selection and returns a winner (or draw), and keeps score.
